# Overview 

Created by Blockstream hacker + Base58 founder [@niftynei](https://x.com/niftynei) in 2021, the [World Famous Bitcoin LARP](https://www.base58.info/classes/larp) (Live Action Role Play) is a fun, hands-on ~2-hour workshop for bitcoiners of all ages and experience. The game has been played at bitcoin conferences and meetups world-wide, and is a fantastic yet challenging way to really understand what is happening on the bitcoin network.

What is a bitcoin node? What does it do? How do transactions flow through the network and get mined?  Come participate in this workshop, and we'll walk through these answers together.

# Learning Outcomes

- Inspecting the contents of a bitcoin-core node  
- Validating a bitcoin transaction  
- Writing a bitcoin transaction  
- Building a peer to peer network  
- Exchanging messages over a peer to peer network  
- Building block templates  
- Mining for new blocks  
- Validating bitcoin blocks

# Class Pre-requisites

- **There’s nothing to know ahead of time.** This activity is good for audiences of all ages, as long as you can _read_, _write_, and do some _basic arithmetic_.
- No prior knowledge of bitcoin or running a node is required, but highly recommended to get the most out of this workshop.
- Bring some snacks/drinks/or other merch to “sell” to participants for in-game bitcoin! We will provide all other [necessary materials](https://github.com/base58btc/LARP/blob/main/BOM.md) to play the game.
