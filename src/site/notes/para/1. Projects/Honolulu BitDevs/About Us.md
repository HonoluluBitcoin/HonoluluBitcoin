Honolulu Bitcoin is a community for those interested in discussing current events and technical developments in the Bitcoin space.

Beyond being a lucrative investment, Bitcoin is a savings technology at its core, and it's a pivotal tool for empowering individuals to take back their financial freedom in the digital age. We dive deep into the concepts and building blocks that make that possible. Although the discussions tend to get technical in nature, **anyone is welcome to join the conversation, regardless of technical expertise!**

Note that this is a group for the exploration of Bitcoin specifically. We will not be discussing investing, "Blockchain" as a general purpose technology, or altcoins and ICOs. **Bitcoin is the signal, and that's what we intend to highlight.**

# Socratic Seminars

We meet at least once every month for our Bitcoin Developers (BitDevs) Socratic Seminar series, which is a format [started by the New York BitDevs chapter and has since spread to many other cities around the US](https://bitdevs.org/cities) (and the rest of the world). Our seminars are designed to foster debate, information sharing, and lively discussion. In the weeks preceding the event, discussion topics are collated by meetup organizers (and members) from a variety of sources.

At some point before the event, a topic list will be posted on the corresponding event page on this website (including primary and optional topics). We try to hit all the primary topics, but optional topics are included in case there is extra time or for interested members to refer back to later. Archives of these discussion topics and presentations are maintained on past event pages.

The discussion portion of the event is generally never recorded or photographed to protect attendee privacy. We also follow the [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule) for sharing information after each event. It is recommended that you have a firm grasp of the basics of Bitcoin in order to extract the most value from our Socratic events, but **feel free to come listen and learn even if you're brand new to the space!**

# Continued Discussion

Outside of our regularly scheduled events, we have ongoing discussions on Bitcoin-related topics in our [Telegram group](https://t.me/+Y5QaLhylSNJjMDEx). That's the best way to learn, network with others, and catch the latest group updates. You can also follow us on Twitter at [@HonoluluBitcoin](https://twitter.com/HonoluluBitcoin?s=20).
