# Coinbase

Coinbase CEO [Brian Armstrong sat down for an interview with The Wall Street Journal](https://youtu.be/ZjLGyWsgbTA) to discuss the crypto regulatory challenges.

# Prime Trust

[Banq, a subsidiary of Prime Trust, also recently filed for bankruptcy](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/14/prime-trust-unit-banq-files-for-bankruptcy/), citing ~$17.72 million in assets against ~$5.4 million in liabilities. The filing also claims that $17.5 million in assets were taken by former executives in an “unauthorized transfer” of trade secrets and proprietary information/technology to a Fortress subsidiary. Fortress is a competing custody firm founded by the same original founder of Prime Trust.
