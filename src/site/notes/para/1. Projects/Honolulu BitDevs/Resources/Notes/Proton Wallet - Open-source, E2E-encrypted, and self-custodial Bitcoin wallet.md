>  # What is Proton Wallet?
>  
>  Our long-term vision is for Proton Wallet to be a digital wallet that gives you full control of your digital assets. While the type of assets that you can hold in Proton Wallet may evolve over time as we add more capabilities in response to community demand, Proton Wallet is starting as a self-custodial Bitcoin wallet. Bitcoin is the most widely adopted digital currency used by millions of people around the world, particularly in countries where inflation is high and citizens are still largely locked out of the traditional banking system. While we may seek to add fiat currency capabilities in the future, this requires a Swiss banking license and is, therefore, not possible today. However, Proton Wallet is not just another self-custody Bitcoin wallet — **it has a number of features that we believe make it the easiest way to introduce Bitcoin safely to newcomers**.

# Why Build Proton Wallet?
PayPal froze funds from Proton's crowdfund in 2014, which highlighted the need for more reliable payment infrastructure.

> [!QUOTE] "Having experienced firsthand the unreliability of the traditional financial sector, building Proton Wallet is an important strategic move to make Proton more resilient and independent in the future. By enabling us and the entire Proton community to more easily adopt means of payment that deliver on the promise of financial freedom for all, we better insulate Proton from the risks posed by traditional finance."

# Unique Features of Proton Wallet

**Mathematically Guaranteed Ownership**

> [!QUOTE] "Proton Wallet is a non-custodial wallet, and we utilize end-to-end encryption to ensure that we never have access to your Bitcoin, even when you are executing transactions via Proton Wallet. Unlike Bitcoin exchanges, Proton never pools your Bitcoin with the coins of other users in a centralized place where they could be accessible to a hacker."

 **Bitcoin via Email**

> [!QUOTE] 
> "One of the goals of Proton Wallet is to **bring Bitcoin out of the domain of the tech-savvy and into the hands of anybody** who wants to access the financial freedom it enables. This was done through conscious user experience and design choices that are apparent once you use the wallet for the first time.

> One of the challenges with managing digital assets like Bitcoin has been the complexity of sending and receiving them, particularly if you want to do it in a private way. This typically requires manually verifying the recipient’s Bitcoin address (a complicated 26-to-62-character alphanumeric identifier that is hard to remember) over a communication channel that may be compromised. For privacy reasons, reusing this alphanumeric identifier multiple times is not advisable, meaning a new address is needed for each transaction.
> 
> By leveraging Proton’s existing encryption key management infrastructure that powers the end-to-end encrypted services that we use to support over 100 million accounts today, **sending and receiving Bitcoin is now as easy as sending and receiving email**. As long as both the sender and recipient have a Proton Wallet, you only need the recipient’s email address to send them Bitcoin. That also means that if you are one of the millions of people who have a Proton Mail email address, you can now automatically receive Bitcoins with your email address.
> 
> Even if the recipient does not have a Proton Mail email, as long as they have a Proton Account (which can also be created with third-party email addresses, like Gmail, Outlook, iCloud, etc.) and are using Proton Wallet, you can [send and receive Bitcoin with them via their email address(new window)](https://proton.me/support/wallet-bitcoin-via-email)."

**Buying Bitcoin**

> [!QUOTE] "If you are new to Bitcoin, Proton Wallet also has integrations that make it easy to buy Bitcoin in 150+ countries. We have also put together a comprehensive Bitcoin guide for newcomers."

**Open Source and Publicly Auditable**

> [!QUOTE] "Like all our services, **Proton Wallet is open source** so all of our security claims can be checked by the public to enhance security. We have also published the [Proton Wallet security model](https://proton.me/blog/proton-wallet-security-model) so you can understand how Proton Wallet protects both privacy and security."

**Enhanced Security with Proton Sentinel**

> [!QUOTE] "Proton Sentinel uses advanced machine learning and AI that’s analyzed millions of logins to detect and block malicious login attempts with high accuracy. This enables Proton to protect your account, even in situations where you have already been compromised and an attacker has gained access to your login credentials."
