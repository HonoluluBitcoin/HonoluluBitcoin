> ## What is Mempool Accelerator™?
> 
> Mempool Accelerator™ is a service to get your stuck transactions confirmed by paying an out of band fee.
> 
> ## How does Mempool Accelerator™ work?
> 
> Mempool sends your acceleration request to our mining pool partners. Partners who choose to accept your acceleration request prioritize your transaction based on your new accelerated fee rate.
> 
> For example, if you use Mempool Accelerator™ to accelerate a 1 sat/vB transaction to a 20 sat/vB target fee rate, mining pool partners will treat the transaction as though it has a 20 sat/vB fee rate.
> 
> ## What payment methods are accepted?
> 
> Pay with Lightning or Cash App Pay, or preload your Mempool Accelerator™ Pro account with credit using onchain BTC or Lightning.
> 
> ## What is the cost to use Mempool Accelerator™?
> 
> Acceleration cost includes:
> - The fee to boost to your selected target fee rate.
> - The Mempool Accelerator™ service fee.
> 
> View your transaction on mempool.space to see the cost breakdown (see customize and details).
