# Description

The [Mempool open source project](https://mempool.space/about) is an extremely popular mempool and block explorer that can be self-hosted and connected to any bitcoin node. Mempool Space is a company that maintains the project and operates the commonly referenced [mempool.space](https://mempool.space/) instance. Because the Mempool Space team is so well-connected across the network, the primary mempool.space instance is often considered the de facto snapshot of bitcoin's global mempool state by many enterprises and individuals. 

At Bitcoin 2023, the [Mempool Space team announced a transaction acceleration marketplace](https://youtu.be/ebLpn_d133Y).
