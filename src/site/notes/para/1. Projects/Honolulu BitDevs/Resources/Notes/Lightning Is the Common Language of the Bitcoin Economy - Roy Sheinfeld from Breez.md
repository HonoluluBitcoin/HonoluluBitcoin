> "Bitcoin is the world’s best currency. Lightning is the common language of the bitcoin world, and it’s here to stay."

# The Need for a Common Language

**Diverse Partnerships**
Breez Technology collaborates with partners from around the world, necessitating a common language for efficient communication. English serves this purpose due to its widespread acceptance and utility, much like how the Lightning Network serves the Bitcoin economy.

> [!QUOTE] "The interface between individual nodes in a network — whether people, nations, or communities — has the form of a language."

**Locked-in Language**
Roy draws parallels between the inevitability of English as a global lingua franca and the Lightning Network's role in Bitcoin. Both are deeply entrenched and difficult to replace due to their widespread adoption and functionality.

> [!QUOTE] "Now for a fact about the present that will irrevocably shape the future: Lightning is emerging as the common language of the bitcoin economy."

# Subnetworks and Interoperability

**Last-Mile Technologies**
The article discusses various last-mile technologies like Ark, Liquid, Fedimint, and Cashu, which facilitate transactions within their subnetworks. Despite their different internal mechanisms, these subnetworks communicate using the Lightning Network.

> [!QUOTE] "Lightning is the common language of all the emergent and thriving subnetworks based on bitcoin."

**Interoperability by Design**
The Lightning Network's design enables multiple implementations of Lightning nodes to interact seamlessly. This inherent interoperability makes it an ideal common language for the Bitcoin economy.

> [!QUOTE] "The Lightning technology detailed in the catalog of bolt specs is inherently interoperable."

# Reasons for Lightning's Dominance

**Trustless Nature**
Lightning's reliance on Bitcoin, a trustless bearer asset, makes it a secure choice for inter-subnetwork communication. It avoids the pitfalls of traditional financial systems that rely on trust and leverage.

> [!QUOTE] "Bitcoin is the only viable bearer asset, and Lightning is the language of Bitcoin, so Lightning is the best common language for the subnetworks to interact with each other."

**Transactional Efficiency**
Lightning's transactional protocol facilitates rapid payments without delays, making it a valuable tool for dynamic financial interactions.

> [!QUOTE] "Payments take seconds, if that. And transactions — money in motion — are what make Lightning valuable."

**Critical Mass**
Lightning has achieved significant adoption, ensuring its status as the de facto common language within the Bitcoin ecosystem.

> [!QUOTE] "Lightning has already achieved a critical mass. It’s already obvious how a Cashu subnetwork and Fedimint subnetworks will communicate with each other: Lightning."
