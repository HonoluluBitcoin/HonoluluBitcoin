Created by [@brqgoo](https://twitter.com/brqgoo). It's a second-layer protocol for making cheap, anonymous off-chain Bitcoin payments - a protocol implementation that follows the the [[para/1. Projects/Honolulu BitDevs/Resources/Notes/Enigma Network\|Enigma Network]] framework.

Although it would benefit from [[para/1. Projects/Honolulu BitDevs/Resources/Notes/OP_CTV\|OP_CTV]]-like covenants, Ark can work on bitcoin today with the tradeoff of requiring interactivity.
