# What is Multi-Party Computation (MPC)?

Multi-party computation (MPC) is a methodology of separating private keys into multiple parts. It's similar to Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS) but in reverse - in SSS, a private key is generated and then split into distributable shards, but in MPC, shards are defined first and come together later to produce a private key signature. A benefit of both SSS and MPC is that they can't be identified on-chain - to observers, it just looks like a single signature.

MPC is often described as an alternative to standard multisignature. Although similar, they approach the challenge of signature aggregation differently:

> ## Comparison to Multi-signature
> 
> From a functional point of view, multi-signature wallets, which use M-of-N keys per wallet, are similar to MPC based wallets, which use M-of-N parts of a key for a single signature wallet.Â The difference is that a multi-signature wallet will make use of distinct signatures generated by distinct private keys to secure the wallet, while MPC uses only creates a single signature regardless of the number of private key parts that participated.
