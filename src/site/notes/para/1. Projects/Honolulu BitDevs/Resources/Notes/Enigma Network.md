Created by [@Polyd_](https://twitter.com/Polyd_). It's a separate scaling layer that leverages [[para/1. Projects/Honolulu BitDevs/Resources/Notes/OP_CTV\|OP_CTV]] covenants. Users send "anchor" bitcoin transactions that commit to a larger set of off-chain transactions by embedding their combined hash into blocks on the base layer. The transactions getting hashed into the blockchain are effectively aggregated together with only a single on-chain transaction.

> - In Bitcoin today, if you need to perform a transaction, you acquire the recipientâ€™s address, create a transaction paying them and then sign it. The Enigma Network will allow you to multi-thread your actions. Instead of sending transactions to be directly mined inside a block, you send an anchor transaction representing all of your transactions.
> - BIP-119 or CheckTemplateVerify (CTV), introduces the capability to pre-commit transactions through pre-signed hashed transactions.
> - To put it in perspective, if Taproot enables signature aggregation, CTV takes it a step further by enabling transaction aggregation. If channels allow you to go up and off-chain, covenants allow you to go down and in-chain.

The Enigma Network is more of a framework that other protocols can fit into. [[para/1. Projects/Honolulu BitDevs/Resources/Notes/Ark\|Ark]] is an example.
