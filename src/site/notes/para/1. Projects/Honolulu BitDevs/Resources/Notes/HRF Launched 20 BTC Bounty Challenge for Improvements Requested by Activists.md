Alex Gladstein, Chief Strategy Officer of the Human Rights Foundation, [announced the Bitcoin Bounty Challenge](https://nitter.at/gladstein/status/1684567095231778818?ref=nobsbitcoin.com) - **20 total BTC to go toward specific improvements to 10 bitcoin-related technologies**. This project was the result of 6 months of field research where HRF staff interviewed dissidents, human rights NGO leaders, and Bitcoin developers from around the world. The goal is to fund a mix of projects that are both impactful to freedom fighters and and realistically achievable near-term for Bitcoin developers.
